# VertexAI Flutter Demo 🚀

This is a tiny demo project that shows how to use [Vertex AI in Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/vertex-ai) in a Flutter application. The goal is to provide a simple, minimal, and fun introduction to integrating AI capabilities into your mobile app via Firebase.

⚠️ This project does **NOT** include Firebase configuration files. You will need to set up Firebase manually (see below).

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

To run this project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Flutter SDK (>= 3.29.3)
- Firebase CLI
- A Firebase project created in the Firebase Console

---

## 🔥 Firebase Setup

Before you run the app, you'll need to connect it to your own Firebase project.

👉 Follow [this guide to set up Firebase](https://medium.com/@suesitran/flutter-interactive-diary-a-developer-diary-3-ca0ce7946801) for your project:

This will generate the necessary configuration files for Firebase to work with Flutter.

## 🧠 Enabling Vertex AI

You'll also need to enable Vertex AI in your Firebase (and underlying GCP) project.

👉 Check out [this guide to enable Vertex AI](https://medium.com/@suesitran/using-vertex-ai-in-firebase-sdks-for-flutter-app-e3dbc81fd044) support in Firebase:

Once that's done, you can start running the app to send prompts and receive generative responses!
